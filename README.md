# EB CLI Installer

## 1. Overview

This repository hosts scripts to generate self-contained installations of the [EB CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/eb-cli3.html).

### 1.1. Prerequisites

You will need to have the following prerequisites installed before running the install script.

* **Git**
  * If not already installed you can download git from the [Git downloads page](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
* **Python**
  * We recommend that you install Python using the [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) Python version manager. Alternately, you can download Python from the [Python downloads page](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
* **virtualenv**
  * Follow the [virtualenv documentation](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/installation.html) to install virtualenv.

## 2. Quick start

### 2.2. Install/Upgrade the EB CLI

```

#### Windows
In **PowerShell** or in a **Command Prompt** window:

```
python .\aws-elastic-beanstalk-cli-setup\scripts\ebcli_installer.py
```

### 2.3. After installation

On Linux and macOS, the output contains instructions to add the EB CLI (and Python) executable file to the shell's `$PATH` variable, if it isn't already in it.

## 3. Usage

The `ebcli_installer.py` Python script will install the [awsebcli](https://pypi.org/project/awsebcli/) package in a virtual environment to prevent potential conflicts with other Python packages.

For most use cases you can execute the `ebcli_installer.py` script with no arguments.

```
python ./aws-elastic-beanstalk-cli-setup/scripts/ebcli_installer.py
```
